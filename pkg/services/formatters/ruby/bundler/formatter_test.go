The above NIST link\ndoes not yet have a published record, and the libxml2 maintainer has declined\nto provide a severity score.\n* Fixed by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/652dd12\n* Further explanation is at https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2022-February/msg00015.html\n\nThe upstream commit and the explanation linked above indicate that an application\nmay be vulnerable to a denial of service, memory disclosure, or code execution if\nit parses an untrusted document with parse options 'DTDVALID' set to true, and 'NOENT'\nset to false.\n\nAn analysis of these parse options:\n\n* While 'NOENT' is off by default for Document, DocumentFragment, Reader, and\nSchema parsing, it is on by default for XSLT (stylesheet) parsing in Nokogiri\nv1.12.0 and later.\n* 'DTDVALID' is an option that Nokogiri does not set for any operations, and so\nthis CVE applies only to applications setting this option explicitly.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that any application explicitly setting the parse\noption 'DTDVALID' when parsing untrusted documents is vulnerable and should be\nupgraded immediately.\n",

However, new connections may still be starved by greedy\npersistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the\ncluster.\n\nA puma server which received more concurrent keep-alive connections than the\nserver had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of\nconnections, denying service to the unserved connections.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in puma 4.3.8 and 5.3.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSetting queue_requests false also fixes the issue. This is not advised when\nusing puma without a reverse proxy, such as nginx or apache, because you will\nopen yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. [slowloris][1]).\n\nThe fix is very small.

"description": "### Impact\n\nPrior to 'puma' version 5.5.0, using 'puma' with a proxy which forwards LF characters as line endings could allow HTTP request smuggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client.\n\nThis behavior (forwarding LF characters as line endings) is very uncommon amongst proxy servers, so we have graded the impact here as \"low\". Puma is only aware of a single proxy server which has this behavior.\n\nIf the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis vulnerability only affects Puma installations without any proxy in front.\n\nUse a proxy which does not forward LF characters as line endings.\n\nProxies which do not forward LF characters as line endings:\n\n* Nginx\n* Apache (>2.4.25)\n* Haproxy\n* Caddy\n* Traefik\n\n### Possible Breakage\n\nIf you are [dealing with legacy clients that want to send 'LF' as a line ending](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43574428/have-apache-accept-lf-vs-crlf-in-request-headers) in an HTTP header, this will cause those clients to receive a '400' error.\n\n### References\n\n* [HTTP Request Smuggling](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling)\n",
