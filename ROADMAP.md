# Horusec Public Roadmap

Our planning focused on the Open Source product and considered a twelve-month vision, presenting the next steps that we have thought about and contributed to the evolution of Horusec. We value quality and transparency during our process, and this will be the primary place to follow Horusec roadmap latest updates. We will keep you informed and adjust our roadmap according to the team's capacity and priorities to maintain quality. On this page, you will follow and be part of Horusec's growth in these areas: **Engineering and product management**. Besides, we have a space for new ideas, **so find out with us**.
